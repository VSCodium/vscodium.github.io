```bash
brew cask install vscodium
```

_Note for Mac OS X Mojave users: if you see "App can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software" when opening VSCodium the first time, you can right-click the application and choose Open. This should only be required the first time opening on Mojave._

### Install with Chocolatey (Windows)
If you use Windows and have [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) installed (thanks to [@Thilas](https://github.com/Thilas)):
```bash
choco install vscodium
```

```

Add the GPG key of the repository:
```bash
wget -qO - https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/master/pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```
 
Add the repository:
```bash
echo 'deb https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/repos/debs/ vscodium main' | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscodium.list

### <a id="flatpak"></a>Flatpak Option (Linux)
VSCodium is not available as a Flatpak app, but [@amtlib-dot-dll](https://github.com/amtlib-dot-dll) has done significant work to package up the open source build of Visual Studio Code without telemetry, very similarly to VSCodium. That package is available [here](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.visualstudio.code.oss) and the build repo is [here](https://github.com/flathub/com.visualstudio.code.oss).
