[@paulcarroty](https://github.com/paulcarroty) has set up a repository for VSCodium [here](https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo). The instructions below are adapted from there. Any issues installing VSCodium using your package manager should be directed to that repository's issue tracker.

#### Debian / Ubuntu (deb package):
Add the GPG key of the repository:
```bash
wget -qO - https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/master/pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```
 
Add the repository:
```bash
echo 'deb https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/repos/debs/ vscodium main' | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscodium.list

### <a id="flatpak"></a>Flatpak Option (Linux)
VSCodium is not available as a Flatpak app, but [@amtlib-dot-dll](https://github.com/amtlib-dot-dll) has done significant work to package up the open source build of Visual Studio Code without telemetry, very similarly to VSCodium. That package is available [here](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.visualstudio.code.oss) and the build repo is [here](https://github.com/flathub/com.visualstudio.code.oss).
