[@paulcarroty](https://github.com/paulcarroty) has set up a [repository](https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo) for VSCodium. The instructions below are adapted from there. Any issues installing VSCodium using your package manager should be directed to that repository's issue tracker.

#### Debian / Ubuntu (deb package):
Install extrepo:
```sh
sudo apt install extrepo
```

Add the repository:
```sh
sudo extrepo enable vscodium
```

Update then install vscodium:
```sh
